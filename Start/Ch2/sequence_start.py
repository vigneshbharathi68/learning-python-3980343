# Sequences: Lists and Tuples
# These are -- surprise -- sequences of values


# to access a member of a sequence type, use []
mylist = [0, 1, 'two', 3.2, False]
print(len(mylist))
print(mylist[2])
print(mylist[-1])
mylist[0] = 10
print(mylist)

# add a list to another list
another_list = [6,7,8]
mylist = mylist + another_list
print(mylist)


# use slices to get parts of a sequence
print(mylist[1:4:2])
print(mylist[::2])


# you can use slices to reverse a sequence
print(mylist[::-1])


# Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable
mytuple = (1,2,"three")
print(mytuple[1])

# Sets are also sequences, but they contain unique values
myset = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 'five'}
print(myset)

# Set, however, can not be indexed like lists or tuples
# print(myset[0]) # this will cause an error

# Test for membership
print(1 in mylist)
print(2 in mytuple)
print(5 in myset)
