# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for working with conditional statements


x, y = 100, 100

# conditional flow uses if, elif, else
if x < y:
  print('x is less than y')
elif x == y:
  print('x is same as y')
else:
  print('x is greater than y')

# conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
result = "x is less than y" if (x < y) else "x is greated or equal to y"
print(result)
