# Dictionary: a key-value data structure
mydict = {
  "one": 1,
  "two": 2,
  3: "three",
  4.5: ["four", "point", "five"]
}
print(mydict)

# dictionaries are accessed via keys
print(mydict['one'])
print(mydict[3])


# you can also set dictionary data by creating a new key
mydict['seven'] = 7
print(mydict)


# Trying to access a nonexistent key will produce an error
print(mydict['blarg'])


# To avoid this, you can use the "in" operator to see if a key exists
print("blarg" in mydict)
print("two" in mydict)


# You can retrieve all of the keys and values from a dictionary
print(mydict.keys())
print(mydict.values())


# You can also iterate over all the items in a dictionary
for key, val in mydict.items():
  print(key, val)
