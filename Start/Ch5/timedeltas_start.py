# construct a basic timedelta and print it

# print today's date one year from now
print("In one year it will be:", now + timedelta(days=365))


# create a timedelta that uses more than one argument
print("In two weeks and 3 days it will be:", now + timedelta(weeks=2, days=3))


# calculate the date 1 week ago, formatted as a string

### How many days until April Fools' Day?
today = date.today()
afd = date(today.year, 4, 1)
print(afd < today)

if afd < today:
  print(f"April fools' already went by {(today - afd).days} days ago")
  afd =  afd.replace(year=today.year + 1)
time_to_afd = afd - today
print(f"It's just {time_to_afd.days} days until April Fools' Day")
