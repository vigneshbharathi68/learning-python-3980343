# the len() function calculates the length of a sequence
print(len(mystring))
print(len(mynumbers))

# the max() and min() functions will find the largest and smallest value in a sequence
print(max(mystring))
print(min(mynumbers))

# the str() function will return a string version of an object
prefix = "result: "
result = 5

print(prefix + str(3.123))


# range(start, stop, step) will create a range of numbers 
# You can use ranges along with loops
for i in range(5, 15, 2):
  print(i) 
 


# the print function itself is pretty flexible - you can embed variables directly in it
